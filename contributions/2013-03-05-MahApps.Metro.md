## My Contributions

MahApps.Metro plays a very important role in bringing VS 2012 like feel for Wide. In order to achieve a similar feel like VS 2012, I had contributed to MahApps.Metro by submitting these PRs:

- [#297](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/pull/297) - Add support for regular menu's (control template & theme)
- [#330](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/pull/330) - Add support for toolbars (control template & theme)
- [#347](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/pull/347) - Basic concept of a GlowWindow
- More coming soon...

I also actively monitor the issues of MahApps.Metro to see if I can fix any for the community.
